   - Some in progress
   - Some with high priority
   - Some with due dates (including overdue)

2. Test sample questions to ensure responses

### **During Demo:**
1. **Start with simple questions** like "What's the project progress?"
2. **Show variety** - ask about different aspects (priority, status, counts)
3. **Highlight intelligence** - show how it understands different phrasings
4. **Demonstrate real-time** - update a task and ask again

### **Common Demo Questions & Expected Responses:**

| Question | Expected Response Type |
|----------|----------------------|
| "What's the project progress?" | Progress percentage and completion stats |
| "Any overdue tasks?" | List of overdue tasks or confirmation none exist |
| "High priority items?" | List of high-priority pending tasks |
| "How many tasks are done?" | Count and list of completed tasks |
